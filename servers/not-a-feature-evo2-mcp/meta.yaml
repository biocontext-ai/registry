name: Evo2 MCP

description: >
  The evo2-mcp server exposes Evo 2 as a MCP server, providing tools for genomic sequence analysis. Any MCP-compatible client can use these tools to score, embed, and generate DNA sequences.

  ### Sequence Scoring

  Evaluate DNA sequence likelihood under the Evo 2 model for genome quality assessment or variant comparison.

  ### Sequence Embedding

  Extract learned feature representations from intermediate model layers for downstream analysis, similarity search, or machine learning pipelines.

  ### Sequence Generation

  Generate novel DNA sequences conditioned on a prompt for synthetic biology, sequence design, or data augmentation.

  ### SNP Variant Effect Prediction

  Score the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on sequence likelihood for variant prioritization and interpretation.
